## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository was created as a space to:

- Practice and document **data analysis workflows** in R  
- Explore **open datasets** from real-world contexts  
- Build clear, reproducible, and visually appealing **reports**  
- Strengthen understanding of **tidyverse**, **ggplot2**, and related packages  
- Showcase progress in data analysis for portfolio and academic use  

Each folder inside the repository represents an independent mini-project — complete with its own R script(s), RMarkdown reports, and discussion of insights.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🦠 1. COVID-19 Data Analysis — Brazil
**Goal:** Analyze the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil using the *Our World in Data (OWID)* dataset.  

**Highlights:**
- Visualized the growth of cases, deaths, and vaccination over time  
- Identified how vaccination reduced fatality rates despite rising case numbers  
- Discussed how the end of sanitary measures led to a resurgence of infections  
- Demonstrated the practical use of R for real epidemiological analysis  

**Tech stack:** `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`

## 💡 Learning Goals

Through each project, I aim to strengthen my skills in:

- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Statistical analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Time-series visualization and interpretation  
- Communicating insights clearly through RMarkdown reports  
- Structuring reproducible analytical workflows
